# acceleration
This repository attempts to answer the following question: can a fast flashy group chat be implemented with HTTP? Yes, under the assumption that long polling can be fast enough. Can it have negligible cost?

Acceleration is a theme that runs through front-end development. We try to first reduce the hours it takes to build a good application, then reduce the seconds it takes for the deployed website to propagate to the clients worldwide. The first one benefits a lot from the open source community, the second one - from proprietary tools.
